    \section*{\textbf{\underline {Conceptual Questions}}}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{
    1. Where must the film be placed if a camera lens is to make a sharp image
    of an object far away?
}
The film must be places behind the lens at the focal length of the lens.
\subsubsection*{
    3.  Can a diverging lens form a real image under any circumstances? Explain. 
}
By itself, no, because by definition a diverging lens causes light rays to
diverge which will not bring the rays to a focus point required for a real image.
However, with the combination of a "stronger" converging lens, we can bring the
rays to a focus point to form a real image.
\subsubsection*{
    8. Compare the mirror equation with the thin lens equation. Discuss similarities
    and differences, especially the sign conventions for the quantities involved.
}
The mirror equation and the lens equation are identical. According to the sign conventions, d > 0
indicates a real object or image and d < 0 indicates a virtual object or image, for both mirrors and
lenses. But the positions of the objects and images are different for a mirror and a lens. For a mirror,
a real object or image will be in front of the mirror and a virtual object or image will be behind the
mirror. For a lens, a real image will be on the opposite side of the lens from a real object, and a
virtual image will be on the same side of the lens as the real object.
\subsubsection*{
    14. The thicker a double convex lens is in the center as compared to its edges,
    the shorter its focal length for a given lens diameter. Explain.
}
A double convex lens causes light rays to converge because the
light bends towards the normal as it enters the lens and away
from the normal as it exits the lens. The result, due to the
curvature of the sides of the lens, is that the light bends towards
the principal axis at both surfaces. The more strongly the sides of
the lens are curved, the greater the bending, and the shorter the
focal length.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/q14.png}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{
    19. You can tell whether people are nearsighted or farsighted by looking at the
    width of their fa e through their glasses. If a person’s face appears narrower
    through the glasses, is the person farsighted or nearsighted? 
}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/q19.jpg}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Nearsighted. Diverging lenses are used to correct nearsightedness and converging lenses are used to
correct farsightedness. If the person’s face appears narrower through the glasses, then the image of
the face produced by the lenses is smaller than the face, virtual, and upright. Thus, the lenses must be
diverging, and therefore the person is nearsighted.
\subsubsection*{
    20. The human eye is much like a camera - yet, when a camera shutter is left open
    and the camera is moved, the image will be blurred. But when you move your head
    with your eyes open, you still see clearly. Explain.
}
All light entering the camera lens while the shutter is open contributes to a single picture. If the
camera is moved while the shutter is open, the position of the image on the film moves. The new
image position overlaps the previous image position, causing a blurry final image. With the eye, new
images are continuously being formed by the nervous system, so images do not “build up” on the
retina and overlap with each other.
\subsubsection*{
    26. For both converging and diverging lenses discuss how the focal length
        from red light differs from that for violet light 
}
For both converging and diverging lenses, the focal point for violet light is closer to the lens than the
focal point for red light. The index of refraction for violet light is slightly greater than for red light
for glass, so the violet light bends more, resulting in a smaller magnitude focal length.

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{The sum of the object and image distances must be the distance between

    \frac{d_o^2-d_Td_o+fd_T}{fd_o(d_T-d_o)} &= 0
    \intertext{so,}
    d_o^2 - d_Td_o+fd_T &= 0
    \intertext{Using the quadratic formula,}
    d_o &= \frac {d_T \pm \sqrt{d_T^2 - 4fd_T}}{2} \\

    \frac 1 f &= \frac 1 {d_o} + \frac 1 {d_i} = \frac 1 {d_o} + \frac 1 {2.95d_o} \\
    \frac 1 {85\;cm} &= \frac{2.95 + 1}{2.95d_o} \rr d_o =
    \frac{3.95}{2.95}(85\;cm) \approx 113.8\;cm\\
    \intertext{so,}
