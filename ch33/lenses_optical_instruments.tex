\end{center}
\subsubsection*{
    1. Where must the film be placed if a camera lens is to make a sharp image
    of an object far away?
}
\subsubsection*{
    3.  Can a diverging lens form a real image under any circumstances? Explain. 
}
\subsubsection*{
    8. Compare the mirror equation with the thin lens equation. Discuss similarities
    and differences, especially the sign conventions for the quantities involved.
}
\subsubsection*{
    14. The thicker a double convex lens is in the center as compared to its edges,
    the shorter its focal length for a given lens diameter. Explain.
}
\subsubsection*{
    19. You can tell whether people are nearsighted or farsighted by looking at the
    width of their fa e through their glasses. If a person’s face appears narrower
    through the glasses, is the person farsighted or nearsighted?

\subsubsection*{
    20. The human eye is much like a camera - yet, when a camera shutter is left open
    and the camera is moved, the image will be blurred. But when you move your head
    with your eyes open, you still see clearly. Explain.
}
\subsubsection*{
    26. For both converging and diverging lenses discuss how the focal length
        from red light differs from that for violet light

\subsubsection*{
    1. A sharp image is located 373 mm behind a 215 mm focal length converging lens.
    Find the object distance (a) using a ray diagram, (b) by calculation.

    2. Sunlight is observed to focus at a point 18.5 cm behind a lens, (a) What kind
    of lens is it? (b) What is its power in diopters?
}
\subsubsection*{
    4. A certain lens focuses an object 1.85 m away as an image 48.3 cm on the other
    side of the lens. What type of lens is it, and what is its focal length?
    Is the image real or virtual?
}
\subsubsection*{
    6. A stamp collector uses a converging lens with focal length 28 cm to view a stamp
    18 cm in front of the lens. (a) Where is the image located? (b) What is the magnification?
}
\subsubsection*{
    10. (a) How far from a 50.0 mm focal length lens must an object be placed if its image
    is to be magnified 2.50X and be real? (b) What if the image is to be virtual and magnified 2.50X?
}
\subsubsection*{
    12. (a) A 2.80 cm-high insect is 1.30 m from a 135 mm focal length lens. Where is the image,
    how high is it, and what type is it? (b) What if f = -135 mm?
}
\subsubsection*{
    13. A bright object and a viewing screen are separated by a distance of 86.0 cm. At what location(s)
    between the object and the screen should a lens of focal length 16.0 cm be placed in order to produce
    a sharp image on the screen? [Hint, first draw a diagram.]
}
\subsubsection*{
    14. How far apart are an object and an image formed by an 85 cm focal length converging lens if the
    image is 2.95X larger than the object and is real?

\subsubsection*{
    20. A diverging lens with f = 33.5 cm is placed 14.0 cm behind a converging lens with f = 20.0 cm.
    Where will an object at infinity be focused?
}
\subsubsection*{
    21. Two 25.0 cm focal length converging lenses are placed 16.5 cm apart. An object is placed 35.0 cm
    in front of one lens. Where w ill the final image formed by the second lens be located? What is the
    total magnification?
}
\subsubsection*{
    26. A diverging lens is placed next to a converging lens of
focal length $f_C$, as in Fig. 33 15. If $f_T$ represents the focal
length of the combination, show that the focal length of the
diverging lens, $f_D$, is given by
\[
    \displaystyle\frac{1}{f_D} = \displaystyle\frac{1}{f_T} -
    \displaystyle\frac{1}{f_C}
\]
}

\subsubsection*{
    27. A lighted candle is placed 36 cm in front of a converging lens of focal length $f_1$ = 13 cm,
    which in turn is 56 cm in front of another converging lens of focal length $f_2$ = 16 cm. (a) Draw a 
    ray diagram and estimate the location and the relative size of the final image. (b) Calculate 
    the position and relative size of the final image.

    the index of refraction of the lens material?

\subsubsection*{
    33. A prescription for a corrective lens calls for +3.50 diopters. The lensmaker grinds the lens from a
    “blank” with n = 1.56 and convex front surface of radius of curvature of 30.0 cm. What should be the radius
    of curvature of the other surface?
